# Question

What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

Since `printDouble` is being invoked within the `forEach` invokation, it will use its return value which is `undefined` because it's not explicitly returning anything.
